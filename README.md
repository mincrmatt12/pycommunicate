# pycommunicate
pycommunicate is a library that wraps flask and flask-socketio to provide you with a really cool thing.

## what can it do?
pycommunicate allows for serverside event handling of js events, and even modifying the dom on the server. This is accomplished
by using socketio, so anything that socketio supports, this should support too.

There's also jinja2 for template rendering, sessions that persist across... sessions, sessions that persist across requests,
support for changing html from one page to another without swapping the page, and much more!

## examples plz

Look in the examples directory. Right now it's a little barren, but that _will_ change
