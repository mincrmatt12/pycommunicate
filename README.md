# pycommunicate
pycommunicate is a library that wraps flask and socketio to provide you with a really cool thing.

## what can it do?
pycommunicate allows for serverside event handling of js events, and even modifying the dom on the server. This is accomplished
by using socketio, so anything that socketio supports, this should support too.

## examples plz

```
# TODO: make an example :(

I promise it will happen soon!
