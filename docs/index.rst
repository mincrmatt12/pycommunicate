Welcome to pycommunicate
========================

What is pycommunicate?
----------------------
pycommunicate is a python web-server library designed to make server-heavy webapps easy!

In other words, this library is similar to others (in fact it wraps flask to work), but with one very amazing difference:
**you can modify the dom from the server**

You can attach events to elements, change properties, and much more!

Want to get started? Well you're in the right place, because this *is* the documentation! :)
