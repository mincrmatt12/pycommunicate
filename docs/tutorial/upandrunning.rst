Installing pycommunicate
------------------------

Alright, first things first: *get the library*

If you don't have pip, go get it using `get-pip.py`_.

.. _get-pip.py: https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py

Then, in a correctly elevated terminal run::

   pip install pycommunicate

If you run windows, you
may need to use::

   python -m pip install pycommunicate

Both will do the same thing.

**That's it!** You have now installed pycommunicate and are ready to proceed to the next step!
